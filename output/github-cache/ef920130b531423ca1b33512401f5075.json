term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) [parties](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/party) as they negotiate and execute electronic [transactions](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/transaction) with one

that gives individuals control over the information they use to prove who they are to [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website), services, and [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) across the web. Without SSI, individuals with persistent accounts (identities) across the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) must rely on a number of large identity providers, such as [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) (Facebook Connect) and [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) (Google Sign-In), that have control of the information associated with their identity.","matches":[{"indices":[138,161],"text":"self-sovereign-identity"}]}]}]}}
